# B-Classification-of-Machine-Failures
● The Binary Classification of Machine Failures project aims to develop an accurate predictive model capable of classifying machine failures into two categories: "Failure" and "Non-Failure." ● The project leverages a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing various features extracted from machines and their corresponding labels indicating whether the machine experienced failure or not. ● My model has achieved a phenomenal accuracy of approximately 98 percent.
